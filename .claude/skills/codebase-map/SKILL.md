description: Where behaviour lives in this repo — a per-area map of which files and line ranges own what, so you can open the right file instead of searching for it. Use before hunting for where something is implemented, before adding a feature that touches existing behaviour, and when a change seems to need edits in more places than expected.

# Where things live

This repo is large enough that finding the right file costs more than reading it.
The pages below are maps: for each area, which files own it and roughly where in
them.

**Pick the area, open that one page, then go straight to the file.** Do not read
every page — that defeats the point.

## Where things live

One page per area of the system. Read before going looking for where
something is implemented.

| page | covers | verified |
|---|---|---|
| [Plugin deploy pipeline](../../../docs/architecture/deploy-pipeline.md) | how a plugin directory gets onto a Kindle, where the gateway reads plugin source, shell fallbacks, plugin packages (gateway /pkg/ and GitHub Releases with registry/index.json) and the upload inbox | 2026-11-03 |
| [Device bridge (agent to Kindle)](../../../docs/architecture/device-bridge.md) | how an agent call reaches a Kindle, which file owns the gateway tools, the stateless MCP transport, the dial-out connection (raw TCP or WebSocket with a device key) and live sessions, screenshots and running on Android | 2026-11-03 |
| [Plugin installer](../../../docs/architecture/plugin-installer.md) | where the on-device plugin installer reads the package list, downloads and checks an archive, swaps the plugin folder, keeps the backup and rolls back | 2026-11-03 |
| [Synced reading list plugin](../../../docs/architecture/synced-reading-list.md) | where the synced reading list sets the progress sync device id from the Kindle serial, fetches the server list, maps books to local files under any of their merged file names, builds rows, filters and searches, refreshes, shows the long-press pop-up, removes a book from the list, chooses which progress sync plugin it works with, and opens a book at its synced position | 2026-11-03 |

The same table, browsable, is [docs/README.md](../../../docs/README.md).

## How to read a line range

Every entry is `file — lines — what lives there`. **The line numbers are a
starting point, not an address.** They drift with every commit that touches the
file above them, and nothing regenerates them.

So: jump to roughly that line, then confirm you are in the right place by what the
code says, not by the number. If a range is off by more than a screen or two, fix
it in the page and re-date it — that is a one-line edit and it is how the map
stays worth having.

Line ranges are given at all because the files that matter most here are big:
`kindle-gateway/src/gateway-server.ts` (517 lines) and `koreader_mcp.koplugin/handlers.lua` (466 lines). "It's in gateway-server.ts" is not an
answer.

## What this map does not tell you

It tells you **where**, not **why it is dangerous**. Several of the areas below
have failure modes that produce no error message. Those are catalogued
separately, by symptom, in the `repo-maintenance` skill and in
[docs/README.md](../../../docs/README.md). If you are about to change shared state
or anything on the plugin deploy path (`deployPlugin`) or the on-device server socket, look there first.

## Keeping it accurate

A map that lies is worse than none, because it sends people confidently to the
wrong file. Two habits keep it honest:

- **Re-date what you touch.** If you worked in an area and the page was right,
  bump `verified:`. If it was wrong, fix it and bump.
- **Add an area when you create one, not later.** A new subsystem with no page is
  invisible; the next person re-derives its shape from scratch.

To add a page, follow the same rules as any other doc — see the `repo-maintenance`
skill. Frontmatter for an area page is `title`, `covers` (what someone would be
looking for, phrased as they would phrase it), and `verified`. Then run
`scripts/gen-docs-index.sh`; the block above is generated and hand edits to it
are overwritten.
